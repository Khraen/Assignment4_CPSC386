# Assignment4_CPSC386
Hi there! check out my action styled side-scrolling/platforming game that I created for a game assignment in unity class. Along with standard enemies and obstacles, it also features two levels, both having their own bosse at the end. Navigate to Releases and select the windows or mac version of the game to download. Hope you Enjoy!
